I am a South Korean young researcher living in Japan since 2008. I was majored in Engineering and especially insterested in plasma physics and controlled fusion; plasma-surface interactions; atmospheric plasma sources and its applications. I am currently working at the University of Tsukuba as an assistant professor.
I love to watch football matches, which I try to find for a local football team there when I go abroad for experiments. I also enjoy watching e-sports matches for the League of Legends.
